This collection showcases my college projects, reflecting the comprehensive data science skills and knowledge I have developed over the past year during my MSc in Data Analytics


- Stock Martket prediction Time Series Forecasting – FAANG Stocks & Twitter Sentiment
•	Developed a stock prediction model using FAANG stock data and corresponding daily Twitter sentiment. Utilized MongoDB for data storage and database evaluation, Apache Spark for distributed processing, and applied SARIMAX, recursive forecasting, and LSTM/RNN models for time series analysis. Results were visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.


- Stock Martket prediction Neural Networks- AAPL
This study explores the integration of Hadoop, Apache Spark and deep learning techniques for predicting stock prices using historical data. Hadoop is utilized for distributed data storage, while Apache Spark enables large scale data preprocessing, distributed computing and efficient handling of vast datasets, ensuring scalability and performance improvement in training. Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNN’s) and long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, are implemented using TensorFlow, demonstrating their superior ability to capture temporal dependencies, showing superior performance to prior machine learning models. TensorFlow was utilized to develop learning models, including recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks. In this task python libraries are used to automatically download historical data used for forecasting with over 10 years of records being analyzed.


- The importance of Tourism in Ireland 
•	Conducted statistical analysis on Irish tourism data (2012–2019) using Poisson, Binomial, and Normal distributions to uncover trends in visitor behaviour and expenditure; developed predictive models with Linear and Decision Tree regression.


- Harnessing Data and Statistics to Drive innovation and sustainability in Irish Agriculture 
•	Performed statistical analysis on EU and Irish agricultural datasets to assess Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) impacts using descriptive statistics, regression, and classification; identified trends in yield, land use, and employment, and visualized results via a Streamlit dashboard.
