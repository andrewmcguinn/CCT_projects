This collection showcases my college projects, reflecting the comprehensive data science skills and knowledge I have developed over the past year during my MSc in Data Analytics




- Stock Martket prediction Time Series Forecasting –
This study presents an integrated approach leveraging NOSQL databases, Apache Spark, time series and deep learning techniques for predicting stock prices using historical data. MongoDB is utilized for flexible and scalable storage, while Apache Spark facilitates large scale data preprocessing, distributed computing, enabling efficient handling of vast datasets, ensuring scalability and performance improvement in training. Time series forecasting models are implemented via the statsmodel library, demonstrating their superior ability to capture temporal dependencies, showing superior performance to prior machine learning models. Deep learning models, particularly long-short term memory (LSTM) networks via TensorFlow are utilized to capture complex temporal dependencies within sequential stock data. The integration of scalable storage, distributed processing and robust time series modeling highlights the potential of this hybrid framework.



- Stock Martket prediction Neural Networks- AAPL
This study explores the integration of Hadoop, Apache Spark and deep learning techniques for predicting stock prices using historical data. Hadoop is utilized for distributed data storage, while Apache Spark enables large scale data preprocessing, distributed computing and efficient handling of vast datasets, ensuring scalability and performance improvement in training. Deep learning models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNN’s) and long-short term memory (LSTM) networks, are implemented using TensorFlow, demonstrating their superior ability to capture temporal dependencies, showing superior performance to prior machine learning models. TensorFlow was utilized to develop learning models, including recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks. In this task python libraries are used to automatically download historical data used for forecasting with over 10 years of records being analyzed.



- The importance of Tourism in Ireland 
•	Conducted statistical analysis on Irish tourism data (2012–2019) using Poisson, Binomial, and Normal distributions to uncover trends in visitor behaviour and expenditure; developed predictive models with Linear and Decision Tree regression.


- Harnessing Data and Statistics to Drive innovation and sustainability in Irish Agriculture 
•	Performed statistical analysis on EU and Irish agricultural datasets to assess Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) impacts using descriptive statistics, regression, and classification; identified trends in yield, land use, and employment, and visualized results via a Streamlit dashboard.
