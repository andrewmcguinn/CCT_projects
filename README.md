Stock Prediction Model – FAANG Stocks & Twitter Sentiment
•	Developed a stock prediction model using FAANG stock data and corresponding daily Twitter sentiment. Utilized MongoDB for data storage and database evaluation, Apache Spark for distributed processing, and applied SARIMAX, recursive forecasting, and LSTM/RNN models for time series analysis. Results were visualized through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
