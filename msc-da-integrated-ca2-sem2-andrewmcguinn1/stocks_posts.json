De-Dollarization Backfires and U.S. Markets Become the Last Safe Haven\nAs countries diversify away from the U.S. dollar, capital might not flow into gold or emerging markets as expected\u2014but instead flood into U.S. equities, especially large-cap tech. In this view, the U.S. remains the most liquid, transparent, and innovation-driven market. Ironically, global distrust of U.S. fiscal policy could boost stocks as foreign capital chases yield and safety in equities, not Treasuries.\n\n\n2. The AI Productivity Supercycle Is Real (and Underestimated)\nThe market may be on the cusp of a productivity revolution akin to the internet boom\u2014or even greater. The belief is that AI, led by companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Meta, will drive exponential gains in corporate earnings and efficiency. If the market begins to price in several years of accelerated earnings growth now, a melt-up to 7000 becomes plausible, especially with retail and institutional money piling in.\n\n\n3. The U.S. Embraces \u201cSoft MMT\u201d (Modern Monetary Theory)\nWhile outright MMT remains taboo, policymakers may continue to blur the line between fiscal and monetary stimulus\u2014effectively funding government programs via asset markets and Fed balance sheet expansion. A \u201csoft MMT\u201d regime could keep equities buoyant through aggressive infrastructure, AI, or social investment bills funded by yield curve control or disguised QE.\n",

This strategy allowed for inflation to exceed the 2% target temporarily to compensate for previous shortfalls. However, the unforeseen surge in inflation post-pandemic has rendered this approach less effective.  \ufffc\n\n\t* Emergence of Persistent Supply Shocks: The economy is facing more frequent and potentially enduring supply shocks, such as those stemming from tariffs, pandemics, and severe weather events. These shocks pose a dual challenge by simultaneously driving up prices and hindering economic growth, complicating the Fed\u2019s policy decisions.  \ufffc\n\n\t* Shift Towards Inflation Control: In light of these challenges, Powell indicated a strategic pivot back to prioritizing inflation control. The Fed aims to develop a policy framework that is robust across various economic conditions, ensuring preparedness for potential downturns while maintaining its commitment to a 2% inflation target.  \ufffc\n\n\t* Implications for Interest Rates: While Powell did not provide specific guidance on immediate interest rate adjustments, the acknowledgment of higher real interest rates and the potential for more volatile inflation suggests that the Fed may maintain elevated rates for an extended period to anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe Fed plans to unveil the revised policy framework between August and September 2025, aiming to enhance its resilience to unforeseen economic developments while upholding its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  \ufffc",

        "author": "thelastsubject123",
        "created_utc": 1747327980.0,
        "selftext": "In the past, turning water into wine was considered a biblical miracle. However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.\n\nLandbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.\n\nLet's break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)\n\nRevenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil & Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.\n\nThe key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.\n\nThe company boasts \"adjusted EBITDA\" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.\n\nI personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.\n\nAs Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.",

TSLA has mainly been on a tear (attributed to Musk stepping away from DOGE and returning to TSLA), and the news of Tesla board exploring a new pay deal for the CEO dropped yesterday.

And there is no scientific spirit, just shout orders.\n\nBut in fact, when I think back to 2017, when I was attending an MBA course at a very small school in Australia, the teacher talked about the concept of CEO Pay Ratio, saying that American companies are as high as 300:1. That is, the gap between grassroots employees and CEOs is 300 times. And the UK, a bad country in Europe, is only 70-100 times. I knew that this salary would not satisfy Musk. Because if Musk's salary is really approved, it will bring the US Pay Ratio to an incredible level. The United States has completely lost any morality.\n\nAlthough the United States is indeed a country where everything is about money and whoever has money is the king, I also see that the strong Delaware judges are trying to maintain the final decency of the judiciary to give social fairness.\n\nCompared to the SEC, which weakly sued Musk and was even broken by Musk, the Delaware judge is the last and best shield of the United States.\n\nThe SEC is a regulatory unit that lacks even the most basic dignity and is far weaker than China's Securities Regulatory Commission.",

        "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/walmart-wmt-q1-2026-earnings.html\n\n\n> Walmart on Thursday fell just short of quarterly sales estimates, as even the world\u2019s largest retailer said it would feel the pinch of higher tariffs.  Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart\u2019s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are \u201cstill too high\u201d \u2013 even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I\u2019m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You\u2019ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.\u201d Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\n\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street\u2019s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\n\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart\u2019s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart\u2019s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales \u2013 an industry metric also known as same-store sales \u2013 jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\n\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. \u201cThey\u2019re discerning. They\u2019re mindful. They\u2019re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They\u2019re still looking for value,\u201d he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to \u201cplay offense\u201d by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\n\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation\u2019s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.",

If a normal analyst puts Tesla's CyberCAB product in this analysis method, he will only have one position, that is, NichePlayers, and even this is overestimating Tesla. After all, Waymo officially has L4 level autonomous driving, while Tesla's FSD is only L2 (in case you haven't heard, Tesla's FSD is only L2, not even L3).\n\n\n\nWaymo is obviously in the leader quadrant. It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).\n\nSo Tesla doesn't even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.\n\nAs of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19? Of course, Musk's good friend, a gentleman in the White House, may be able to slam the table and roar angrily, demanding that NHTSA officials unconditionally let his best political allies and election campaigners start Robotaxi business immediately.\n\n\n\nFrom my perspective, the US stock market really feels like the Nasdaq bubble in 2000. It is full of lies and incompetence at the regulatory level. The entire market is either VR, AR or AI, quantum chips (here again, quantum algorithms do not solve the problem of general computing. Before 2022, there were many research projects in the United States to study how to accelerate quantum computing for general computing, and they all failed), autonomous driving, and cryptocurrency. Remove MAG7, where is the value of the United States?\n\nIn my opinion, Europe is better than the United States. The European academic community does not brag about AI, but focuses on researching colliders.\n\nI once asked a friend from NASA, \"Why don't you launch more deep space satellites to explore the universe?\" Their answer was \"Space science is not like Silicon Valley, where you can just blow bubbles. Space research requires a lot of objective conditions, and these objective conditions are calculated based on decades or even hundreds of years, such as planets connecting in a straight line. This kind of opportunity requires a long wait, and before the astronomical conditions are met, there is very little that humans can do).\n\nI will write about the current AI scams when I have time, which is also a purely rational analysis.\n\nFinally, I want to thank the administrators here. I have been banned in several forums for telling the truth.",

But I am firm in my opinion because I am different from other investors. I have two undergraduate degrees in IT and economics, and I am also a mechanical enthusiast in my spare time. I understand mechanics, economics and IT better than others. I believe that the release date of Cybercab will be another Enron and Tesla's doomsday. How can it be achieved unless his good friend, the president, helps.\n\nAll the achievements of BEV today are based on government subsidies. In 2024, after the European government cancelled the BEV subsidies, the sales of hybrid and Toyota immediately increased. So when countries around the world gradually canceled the subsidies for electric vehicles in the next few years, who will buy them? Of course, the president's friends can ask the federal government to buy them at the government level.\n\nToday, Tesla's market value is higher than Toyota, GM and Honda. This is really a joke.\n\nMany people also told me that \"Tesla is not just a car company, it is the future, Mars, artificial intelligence, and innate intelligence. It will replace all humans.\"\n\nI don't want to discuss this topic with people who have no science and engineering background anymore. Really, there is a saying in China that \"if you don't cheat a fool's money, it's a waste.\" These people are the same.\n\nSometimes I really feel strange about the US stock market. The SEC is like a thing that bullies the weak and clings to the powerful. On the contrary, even the China Banking Regulatory Commission, which is called the \"fraud market\", has always been a heavy-handed strike in regulating companies. It's just that it must cooperate with the Chinese government to control stock prices and the stock market, but it has never been afraid of any company. And the SEC is too weak.",

What\u2019s the next 5x? What are you buying? But honestly, I\u2019ve found the real challenge is knowing what to do once something you own starts ripping.\n\nI\u2019ve had this happen a few times now. I\u2019d get in early on something, maybe just messing around with a small position, and then suddenly it\u2019s up 200%, 300%, sometimes more. And I\u2019d love to say I calmly trimmed, locked in profit, and moved on. But that\u2019s not how it went.\n\nUsually you start getting emotional. You feel smart. You tell yourself it\u2019s going higher. You start thinking about what your gain could be if you just held a little longer. Sometimes you even add more. I\u2019ve done that. Then it pulls back 40%, and now you\u2019re stuck. Selling feels wrong. Holding feels worse. You just sit there watching it bleed.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s helped me is trying to think of selling the same way I think about buying. When a position gets big and my portfolio value starts growing fast, I\u2019ll stop and ask: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t own this stock right now, would I be comfortable putting this amount of money into it at this current price and chart?\u201d\n\nMost of the time, the answer is no. That\u2019s when I know I probably need to trim. I don\u2019t want one name becoming way too outsized just because I\u2019m emotionally tied to it. Rebalancing feels more like a risk management decision than some emotional call to dump the stock. And honestly, it helps a lot.\n\nAnother thing is selling in chunks. I might trim a bit after a double. More if it keeps going. That way I\u2019m locking something in but still giving it room to run. I try not to beat myself up if it goes higher after I sell. That\u2019s just part of the game.\n\nI\u2019ve still made plenty of mistakes. I\u2019ve round-tripped some great trades because I got greedy or froze. But I\u2019m starting to learn that having some kind of exit mindset early on makes everything easier. Even just writing down a rough plan or price target helps take the edge off when it comes time to decide.\n\nAnyway, just sharing my experience. If you\u2019ve ever held too long, sold too early, or felt stuck on what to do when you\u2019re up big, you\u2019re definitely not the only one. Curious how other people think about this stuff too.",

        "author": "iD-10T_usererror",
        "created_utc": 1747242937.0,
        "selftext": "I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.\n\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).\n\nI don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.\n\n**Buyers (shares/% increase in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Added|Percent Increase in Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Vanguard|3,694,524|1.519%|\n|Blackrock|3,482,055|1.722%|\n|Geode Capital Management|2,487,085|4.076%|\n|JPM\\*|3,426,144|9.52%|\n|Goldman Sachs|14,670,839|123.081%|\n|Charles Schwab|849,091|4.901%|\n|Invesco|2,211,300|17.585%|\n|Nuveen|12,531,327|new|\n|Citigroup|3,611,937|47.184%|\n|Deutsche Bank|1,733,531|20.778%|\n|Assenagon Asset Management|2,978,026|54.277%|\n|Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group|456,356|5.793%|\n|Swiss National Bank|26,100|0.321%|\n|Hsbc Holdings|19,426|0.242%|\n|National Bank Of Canada\\*|5,566,098|307.721%|\n|Franklin Resources|860|0.013%|\n|National Pension Service|172,845|3.345%|\n|Mitsubishi Ufj Asset Management|578,266|12.34%|\n|Rhumbline Advisers|20,295|0.39%|\n|Dimensional Fund Advisors|119,500|2.577%|\n|Wells Fargo|1,176,846|35.262%|\n|Aberdeen Group|1,729,053|65.228%|\n\n*\\*JPM analyst has one of the lowest price targets on Tesla and Canada was supposed to be \"mad\" at America. Ha! Not so much obviously...*\n\n**Sellers (shares/% decrease in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Sold|Percent Decrease In Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Capital World Investors|(954,950)|\\-2.317%|\n|Fmr LLC|(4,448,041)|\\-12.883%|\n|Northern Trust Corp|(992,003)|\\-3.471%|\n|Bank Of New York Mellon|(418,764)|\\-2.46%|\n|Wellington Management Group|(1,285,882)|\\-12.639%|\n|Jennison Associates|(994,502)|\\-10.239%|\n|Capital Research Global Investors|(755,524)|\\-9.637%|\n|Primecap Management|(473,525)|\\-6.267%|\n|American Century Companies|(157,691)|\\-2.183%|\n|Bank Of Montreal|(50,142)|\\-0.729%|\n|Ubs Group Ag|(757,244)|\\-10.429%|\n|California Public Employees Retirement System\\*|(60,314)|\\-1.265%|\n|Principal Financial Group Inc|(165,095)|\\-4.362%|\n|New York State Common Retirement Fund\\*|(112,326)|\\-3.195%|\n|Ark Investment Management|(28,594)|\\-0.87%|\n\n*\\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*\n\nAgain, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \\~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).\n\nMy takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.",

De-Dollarization Backfires and U.S. Markets Become the Last Safe Haven\nAs countries diversify away from the U.S. dollar, capital might not flow into gold or emerging markets as expected\u2014but instead flood into U.S. equities, especially large-cap tech. In this view, the U.S. remains the most liquid, transparent, and innovation-driven market. Ironically, global distrust of U.S. fiscal policy could boost stocks as foreign capital chases yield and safety in equities, not Treasuries.\n\n\n2. The AI Productivity Supercycle Is Real (and Underestimated)\nThe market may be on the cusp of a productivity revolution akin to the internet boom\u2014or even greater. The belief is that AI, led by companies like NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Meta, will drive exponential gains in corporate earnings and efficiency. If the market begins to price in several years of accelerated earnings growth now, a melt-up to 7000 becomes plausible, especially with retail and institutional money piling in.\n\n\n3. The U.S. Embraces \u201cSoft MMT\u201d (Modern Monetary Theory)\nWhile outright MMT remains taboo, policymakers may continue to blur the line between fiscal and monetary stimulus\u2014effectively funding government programs via asset markets and Fed balance sheet expansion. A \u201csoft MMT\u201d regime could keep equities buoyant through aggressive infrastructure, AI, or social investment bills funded by yield curve control or disguised QE.\n", "score": 0, "comments": 11}

This strategy allowed for inflation to exceed the 2% target temporarily to compensate for previous shortfalls.

These shocks pose a dual challenge by simultaneously driving up prices and hindering economic growth, complicating the Fed\u2019s policy decisions.  \ufffc\n\n\t* Shift Towards Inflation Control: In light of these challenges, Powell indicated a strategic pivot back to prioritizing inflation control. The Fed aims to develop a policy framework that is robust across various economic conditions, ensuring preparedness for potential downturns while maintaining its commitment to a 2% inflation target.  \ufffc\n\n\t* Implications for Interest Rates: While Powell did not provide specific guidance on immediate interest rate adjustments, the acknowledgment of higher real interest rates and the potential for more volatile inflation suggests that the Fed may maintain elevated rates for an extended period to anchor inflation expectations.\n\nThe Fed plans to unveil the revised policy framework between August and September 2025, aiming to enhance its resilience to unforeseen economic developments while upholding its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  \ufffc", "score": 372, "comments": 115}

However, with the rise of AI, anyone can now do this incredible feat by investing in Landbridge.\n\nLandbridge is a company that owns land, focusing on the Delaware sub-basin within the Permian Basin. For those unaware, this region is known for having the most active oil and natural gas exploration in the US. If this sounds familiar, its business model and area of activity is similar to the highly successful Teas Pacific ($TPL). However, a massive difference between TPL and LB is LB primarily relies on water royalties for their revenues.\n\nLet's break down their most recent 1Q25 Earnings: [https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc\\_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck\\_vF.pdf](https://s204.q4cdn.com/780627658/files/doc_presentation/2025/LandBridge-Q1-25-Earnings-Deck_vF.pdf)\n\nRevenue came in at $44M, up 131% YoY. 59% came from royalties of land usage. 33% Came from royalties of sales of water/products obtained from land. Only 8% came from royalties from actual Oil & Gas Production. The bulk of these revenues are due to the water needs of high power data centers. As companies continue to develop $10B+ data centers, the access of water is what enables the usage of these centers, creating a continuous revenue opportunity for LB.\n\nThe key takeaway is Landbridge does not take on any production/capex risk- it is simply a landowner that allows other companies to operate their production on their assets. This makes it an extremely high margin business, making Visa/Nvidia look inefficient.\n\nThe company boasts \"adjusted EBITDA\" margins of 88%. That being said, current GAAP net margins are at 35%, a far cry from the expected 90% management alludes to. This is due to SBC and Interest Expense  due to debt issued to fuel land acquisition. In addition, quarterly FCF is down 40% YoY from $27M to $16M. This is due to a temporary increase in accounts receivable that will be normalized as revenue is recognized.\n\nI personally believe that this is palatable for the moment. There is only so much prime attractive land and I would rather LB acquire it now to generate incredible cash flow in the future. For example, the most recent purchase of Bone Ranch for $245M. This led to a 70% QoQ increase in water royalty volumes and will bring in a MINIMUM of $25M per year for the next 5 years. Again, this is all revenue with essentially 90% margins. These are accretive purchases that will payoff tenfold in the coming years.\n\nAs Landbridge continues to engage in accretive M&A to accelerate high margin revenue, the thesis continues to strengthen alongside the growth of water intensive data centers.", "score": 3, "comments": 5}

Even so, the Arkansas-based discounter stuck by its full-year forecast, which calls for sales to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share for the fiscal year. That cautious profit outlook had disappointed Wall Street in February. Walmart also marked a milestone: It posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally. The business has benefitted from the growth of higher-margin moneymakers, including online advertising and Walmart\u2019s third-party marketplace.  In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said tariffs are \u201cstill too high\u201d \u2013 even with the recently announced agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days. \n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more than any supplier can absorb. And so I\u2019m concerned that consumer is going to start seeing higher prices. You\u2019ll begin to see that, likely towards the tail end of this month, and then certainly much more in June.\u201d Walmart said it expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earning per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.\n\n> Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the three-month period that ended May 2 compared with Wall Street\u2019s estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n- Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted vs. 58 cents expected\n\n- Revenue: $165.61 billion vs. $165.84 billion expected\n\n> In the fiscal first quarter, Walmart\u2019s net income fell to $4.49 billion, or 56 cents per share, compared with $5.10 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose about 2.5% from $161.51 billion in the year-ago period, but had a 1% headwind from lapping Leap Day in the year-ago period. Yet it marked Walmart\u2019s first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. Comparable sales \u2013 an industry metric also known as same-store sales \u2013 jumped 4.5% for Walmart U.S. and 6.7% for Sam\u2019s Club, excluding fuel. E-commerce sales increased 21% in the U.S., marking the 12th straight quarter of double-digit gains. Global e-commerce sales jumped 22% year over year.\n\n> Walmart is often seen as a barometer for the health of the U.S. consumer because of its thousands of stores and large customer base that cuts across age, income and region. Rainey told CNBC that Walmart has not seen a noticeable shift in consumer behavior from previous quarters. \u201cThey\u2019re discerning. They\u2019re mindful. They\u2019re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases, but their behaviors largely have not changed. They\u2019re still looking for value,\u201d he said. Still, he said, Walmart plans to \u201cplay offense\u201d by keeping its price gaps below competitors. He said the company will absorb some of the higher prices from tariffs and expects suppliers will, too.\n\n> Unlike some of its peers, Walmart has advantages that have helped it better weather an uncertain economy and woo a more selective U.S. consumer. As the nation\u2019s largest grocer, it sells food and necessities that drive steadier store and website traffic. And as a well-known value player, it can use lower prices to attract even middle- and upper-income customers who want to pay less. Already, Walmart has attracted wealthier shoppers with faster deliveries, store remodels and a wider assortment of brands.", "score": 230, "comments": 37}

If a normal analyst puts Tesla's CyberCAB product in this analysis method, he will only have one position, that is, NichePlayers, and even this is overestimating Tesla. After all, Waymo officially has L4 level autonomous driving, while Tesla's FSD is only L2 (in case you haven't heard, Tesla's FSD is only L2, not even L3).\n\n\n\nWaymo is obviously in the leader quadrant. It has launched fully autonomous Robotaxis in Phoenix and San Francisco. It has been successfully running for six years since 2019, although there have been many funny accidents during this period. But Waymo at least dares to claim that it has L4, not L3, or L3 plus, or like FSD, which is obviously L2 but induces the driver to let go. (By the way, L2 allows the driver to take both hands off the steering wheel, and only the United States can do this in the world).\n\nSo Tesla doesn't even have L4 autonomous driving, so what can it use to compete with Waymo, which dares to apply for L4 and uses lidar technology that is ridiculed by Tesla fans. L2 means that the responsibility is put on the driver, but L4 requires Waymo to pay for every accident with real money.\n\nAs of 15/May/2025 (sorry, we are used to typing dates like this in Australia). Tesla has not submitted an application for L4 autonomous driving, so I would like to ask Tesla fans. What will they use to make Cybercab on June 19? Of course, Musk's good friend, a gentleman in the White House, may be able to slam the table and roar angrily, demanding that NHTSA officials unconditionally let his best political allies and election campaigners start Robotaxi business immediately.\n\n\n\nFrom my perspective, the US stock market really feels like the Nasdaq bubble in 2000. It is full of lies and incompetence at the regulatory level. The entire market is either VR, AR or AI, quantum chips (here again, quantum algorithms do not solve the problem of general computing. Before 2022, there were many research projects in the United States to study how to accelerate quantum computing for general computing, and they all failed), autonomous driving, and cryptocurrency. Remove MAG7, where is the value of the United States?\n\nIn my opinion, Europe is better than the United States. The European academic community does not brag about AI, but focuses on researching colliders.\n\nI once asked a friend from NASA, \"Why don't you launch more deep space satellites to explore the universe?\" Their answer was \"Space science is not like Silicon Valley, where you can just blow bubbles. Space research requires a lot of objective conditions, and these objective conditions are calculated based on decades or even hundreds of years, such as planets connecting in a straight line. This kind of opportunity requires a long wait, and before the astronomical conditions are met, there is very little that humans can do).\n\nI will write about the current AI scams when I have time, which is also a purely rational analysis.\n\nFinally, I want to thank the administrators here.

What\u2019s the next 5x? What are you buying? But honestly, I\u2019ve found the real challenge is knowing what to do once something you own starts ripping.\n\nI\u2019ve had this happen a few times now. I\u2019d get in early on something, maybe just messing around with a small position, and then suddenly it\u2019s up 200%, 300%, sometimes more. And I\u2019d love to say I calmly trimmed, locked in profit, and moved on. But that\u2019s not how it went.\n\nUsually you start getting emotional. You feel smart. You tell yourself it\u2019s going higher. You start thinking about what your gain could be if you just held a little longer. Sometimes you even add more. I\u2019ve done that. Then it pulls back 40%, and now you\u2019re stuck. Selling feels wrong. Holding feels worse. You just sit there watching it bleed.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s helped me is trying to think of selling the same way I think about buying. When a position gets big and my portfolio value starts growing fast, I\u2019ll stop and ask: \u201cIf I didn\u2019t own this stock right now, would I be comfortable putting this amount of money into it at this current price and chart?\u201d\n\nMost of the time, the answer is no. That\u2019s when I know I probably need to trim. I don\u2019t want one name becoming way too outsized just because I\u2019m emotionally tied to it. Rebalancing feels more like a risk management decision than some emotional call to dump the stock. And honestly, it helps a lot.\n\nAnother thing is selling in chunks. I might trim a bit after a double. More if it keeps going. That way I\u2019m locking something in but still giving it room to run. I try not to beat myself up if it goes higher after I sell. That\u2019s just part of the game.\n\nI\u2019ve still made plenty of mistakes. I\u2019ve round-tripped some great trades because I got greedy or froze. But I\u2019m starting to learn that having some kind of exit mindset early on makes everything easier. Even just writing down a rough plan or price target helps take the edge off when it comes time to decide.\n\nAnyway, just sharing my experience. If you\u2019ve ever held too long, sold too early, or felt stuck on what to do when you\u2019re up big, you\u2019re definitely not the only one. Curious how other people think about this stuff too.", "score": 71, "comments": 84}
{"id": "1kmks0z", "title": "Tesla Institutional Investor Movement- Mixed Bag- Mostly Positive", "author": "iD-10T_usererror", "created_utc": 1747242937.0, "selftext": "I said I would post when the latest release of institutional holdings on Tesla to come out to see if the \"smart money\" had any change in sentiment. The answer seems to be: Not really. If anything, there are some large institutional investors showing continued bullish trends, with a few even becoming wildly bullish and making huge moves, clearly expecting lots of upside. And I am a Tesla bear holding a battered short position but trying to remain at least a little objective on this matter. If this is what the \"smart money\" is doing, it doesn't look good for the bears.\n\nFrom the previous round of reports posted on the Nasdaq website, overall institutional ownership increased 1.11% from 47.37% to 48.48%. Additionally, the total number of institutional holders increased 1.75%, from 4020 to 4091. Just looking at the 3/31/25 filing date, there were 138 firms that opened new positions and 362 that completely closed their positions. Most firms that were both opening new positions and closing positions were relatively small in terms of total shares bought/sold with the exception of Nuveen, which opened a huge new position (listed below).\n\nI don't have access to the raw data but here are some notable moves from the 3/31/25 (submitted/visible 45-days after) reporting date of the larger firms that have substantial holdings of Tesla that are at least in the billions.\n\n**Buyers (shares/% increase in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Added|Percent Increase in Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Vanguard|3,694,524|1.519%|\n|Blackrock|3,482,055|1.722%|\n|Geode Capital Management|2,487,085|4.076%|\n|JPM\\*|3,426,144|9.52%|\n|Goldman Sachs|14,670,839|123.081%|\n|Charles Schwab|849,091|4.901%|\n|Invesco|2,211,300|17.585%|\n|Nuveen|12,531,327|new|\n|Citigroup|3,611,937|47.184%|\n|Deutsche Bank|1,733,531|20.778%|\n|Assenagon Asset Management|2,978,026|54.277%|\n|Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Group|456,356|5.793%|\n|Swiss National Bank|26,100|0.321%|\n|Hsbc Holdings|19,426|0.242%|\n|National Bank Of Canada\\*|5,566,098|307.721%|\n|Franklin Resources|860|0.013%|\n|National Pension Service|172,845|3.345%|\n|Mitsubishi Ufj Asset Management|578,266|12.34%|\n|Rhumbline Advisers|20,295|0.39%|\n|Dimensional Fund Advisors|119,500|2.577%|\n|Wells Fargo|1,176,846|35.262%|\n|Aberdeen Group|1,729,053|65.228%|\n\n*\\*JPM analyst has one of the lowest price targets on Tesla and Canada was supposed to be \"mad\" at America. Ha! Not so much obviously...*\n\n**Sellers (shares/% decrease in overall position):**\n\n|Institution|Shares Sold|Percent Decrease In Position|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Capital World Investors|(954,950)|\\-2.317%|\n|Fmr LLC|(4,448,041)|\\-12.883%|\n|Northern Trust Corp|(992,003)|\\-3.471%|\n|Bank Of New York Mellon|(418,764)|\\-2.46%|\n|Wellington Management Group|(1,285,882)|\\-12.639%|\n|Jennison Associates|(994,502)|\\-10.239%|\n|Capital Research Global Investors|(755,524)|\\-9.637%|\n|Primecap Management|(473,525)|\\-6.267%|\n|American Century Companies|(157,691)|\\-2.183%|\n|Bank Of Montreal|(50,142)|\\-0.729%|\n|Ubs Group Ag|(757,244)|\\-10.429%|\n|California Public Employees Retirement System\\*|(60,314)|\\-1.265%|\n|Principal Financial Group Inc|(165,095)|\\-4.362%|\n|New York State Common Retirement Fund\\*|(112,326)|\\-3.195%|\n|Ark Investment Management|(28,594)|\\-0.87%|\n\n*\\*I assume these sales are politically motivated to some extent.*\n\nAgain, trying to be objective here, it clearly looks like moves to the upside are being made by more prominent name firms and in more dramatic fashion. There are two firms with over a billion in holdings that added triple digit percent increases and Nuveen, that made a massive move to rush in. Of course, I could go down the huge list of transactions and cherry pick things to paint the picture either way. Are there firms with hundreds of millions in holdings cutting their position by \\~50%? Yes. But there are actually more making the opposite/optimistic move (as the overall numbers at the beginning of this post indicate).\n\nMy takeaway: The big boys are making huge moves on Tesla. There is a lot of institutional activity in general, with astonishing sums of money being injected into the stock by big name firms. Net flows in are larger than net flows out. Don't shoot the messenger- But the indicator is bullish. And the recent stock trend reflects it.", "score": 15, "comments": 18}
